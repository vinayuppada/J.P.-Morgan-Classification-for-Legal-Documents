# J.P.-Morgan-Classification-for-Legal-Documents

Introduction:
J.P. Morgan developed COIN (Contract Intelligence), an AI-powered system that automates the review of commercial loan agreements. Previously requiring 360,000 hours of manual work by lawyers and loan officers, COIN completes this task within seconds, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

Learning Outcomes:

Translating a business problem into an analytical problem using CRISP-DM methodology.

Understanding machine learning applications in document classification.

Background:
COIN uses image recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze contracts. While the proprietary details remain undisclosed, the system identifies and categorizes contract clauses into 150+ attributes, improving compliance and risk assessment.

Scenario & Impact:

COIN significantly reduces time spent on contract review and loan-servicing mistakes.

J.P. Morgan aims to expand COIN’s capabilities to credit-default swaps and custody agreements, leveraging machine learning for regulatory interpretation.

Problem Statement:
How can the CRISP-DM framework be applied to automate the classification of legal documents?

Key Steps (CRISP-DM Approach):

Business Understanding: Define objectives—reduce errors, increase efficiency.

Data Understanding: Analyze contract data, clause patterns, and legal terminologies.

Data Preparation: Clean, preprocess, and structure unstructured legal text.

Modeling: Implement NLP and ML models for classification.

Evaluation: Validate accuracy in clause recognition and classification.

Deployment: Integrate COIN into J.P. Morgan’s legal workflow.
